## Quick Reference Card (For Tomorrow)

### Elevator Pitch (30 sec)
"RHDH is an enterprise developer portal built on Backstage - the open-source platform created by Spotify. It gives developers one place to discover services, create projects, access docs, and monitor systems. Instead of switching between 10+ tools, everything is in one portal. Red Hat adds enterprise features like RBAC, AI assistance, and production-ready setup. It's like Google Maps for your infrastructure."

### One-Liner Per Feature
- **Backstage:** "Open-source framework from Spotify, used by 1000+ companies"
- **RHDH:** "Backstage + enterprise features + Red Hat support"
- **Catalog:** "Google for your internal services"
- **Templates:** "Create production-ready service in 5 minutes"
- **TechDocs:** "Docs that live with code and never go stale"

### Key Stats to Remember
- **Onboarding:** 2 weeks → 2 days (85% faster)
- **Service creation:** 4 hours → 5 minutes (98% faster)
- **Context switching:** 10+ tools → 1 portal (90% reduction)
- **ROI:** 3-6 months payback period

### If Asked About Advanced Features
"RHDH includes RBAC for security, Lightspeed AI for intelligent assistance, scorecards for tracking service quality, dynamic plugins for zero-downtime updates, and deep Red Hat ecosystem integration. These enterprise features make it production-ready. I'm happy to chat more after the talk or you can reach out to me on LinkedIn!"
